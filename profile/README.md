# inducio GmbH

**Your specialist for secure infrastructure operation.**

We plan, build, and operate secure network and security infrastructures — for critical infrastructure (KRITIS) operators and companies where availability, security, and transparency are business-critical. Founded in 2010 in Traunstein, Bavaria, we have grown from first-level support projects into a 25-person team with 15+ years of hands-on infrastructure expertise and 30+ technology and solution partners.

## What We Do

We help organizations run complex IT infrastructures in a stable, transparent, and secure way — with minimal overhead for their own teams. Our work spans the full lifecycle: from initial architecture and implementation through to 24/7 managed operation and continuous security monitoring.

### NOC & Infrastructure Monitoring
Round-the-clock monitoring across 500,000+ sensors — from basic availability checks to detailed SNMP monitoring of hardware, environmental metrics, bandwidth, interfaces, services, and applications. We detect anomalies before they become outages.

### Network Security Monitoring (SOC)
Centralized evaluation of network and host data to detect anomalies, attempted attacks, and suspicious behavioral patterns early — powered by modern analysis methods and continuous threat intelligence integration.

### IT Security Checks & Vulnerability Assessment
Regular vulnerability scans at both network and host level. We identify security gaps early, assess risk, prioritize remediation, and deliver clear, actionable recommendations.

### Managed Network Services
We design and operate secure network architectures following BSI guidelines and the **P-A-P principle** (Portfilter – Application Layer Gateway – Portfilter) — providing multi-layered protection and full auditability for ISO 27001 and BSI compliance.

### Attack Detection Systems (SzA)
BSI-compliant attack detection systems for KRITIS operators, combining NOC and SOC operations for organizations with the highest security and regulatory requirements.

### Asset Management & Network Access Control
Our **COD (Central Operations Dashboard)** platform — available hosted, hybrid, or on-premises — provides manufacturer-independent management of all devices, locations, and configurations, with NAC (MAC-based authentication, dynamic VLAN assignment) and automated topology detection.

## Who We Serve

Our customers operate in industries where network downtime or a security breach is simply not an option:

- **KRITIS operators** — electricity and gas providers, telecommunications, healthcare
- **Mechanical and plant engineering**
- **Manufacturing and service companies**
- **Medium-sized enterprises** with high availability and security requirements

## Our Approach

Every engagement follows the same methodology:

1. **Analysis & Workshop** — understand your environment, requirements, and risk profile
2. **Concept & Implementation** — architect and deploy the right solution
3. **Operation & Monitoring** — take ownership of ongoing operation so your team doesn't have to

We are manufacturer-independent and combine enterprise and open-source technologies to build solutions that genuinely fit — not vendor lock-in.
